# Design Patters in Swift and Kotlin. Comparison

## Creational

### Singleton

> Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

### Factory method

> Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Abstract factory

> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder

> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
>
>**Source:** [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern)

### Prototype

> Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects from the 'skeleton' of an existing object, thus boosting performance and keeping memory footprints to a minimum.
